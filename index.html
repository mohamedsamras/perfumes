<h1>About Us</h1><hr>
<p class="int">Here are some things you can write about perfume:
    Perfume types
    Perfumes can be categorized by their dominant fragrance, such as floral, spicy, woody, or oriental. 
    Perfume ingredients
    Perfumes are made from essential oils or synthetic compounds that come from plants, spices, or animals. 
    Perfume concentration
    The concentration of aromatic compounds in a perfume determines its intensity and longevity. The most common terms for perfume concentration include parfum, eau de parfum, and eau de toilette. 
    Perfume history
    The word "perfume" comes from the Latin term per fumum, which means "through smoke". Early perfumes were made from aromatic resins and oils that were burned to release their scent. 
    Perfume application
    People apply perfume to their neck, wrists, and back of the knee because these areas are warmer, which makes the perfume smell stronger. 
    Perfume description
    When describing a perfume, you can use sensory words like "crisp", "fresh", "warm", "velvety", or "soft". </p>
